The main event is, of course, the YouTube channel.
But there are many other ways to get involved and enjoy 3Blue1Brown content.

If you want to ask questions, share interesting math, discuss videos, or just give an impassioned rant about how wonderful math is, take a look at the 3blue1brown subreddit.
People share projects theyâ€™re working on here, like their own videos, animations, and interactive lessons.
These sometimes get added to videos descriptions as additional resources.

And of course, you can follow on all the other usual social media suspects.
Sometimes you'll get a sneak-peek of future animations on Twitter and Instagram!
