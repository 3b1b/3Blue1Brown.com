Figma:

Outlined text can create dramatic size increase in SVG (250KB versus 50KB when testing for "dr")

Figure width scaling notes:

600 - 400
612 -  408
720 - 480
1080 - 720

Video restrained by same width can cause weird behavior for tall images.

Latex:

Vertical scroll bar + clipping for math display equations

Double escape characters in aligned environment

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Area } &=\frac{1}{2} b h \\\\
&=\frac{1}{2}(R)(2 \pi \cdot R) \\\\
&=\pi R^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Research better way to extract video clips other than the quicktime trim tool
