In fact, as thanks for even coming to visit this page, here’s a [secret video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojr8294tzmA).

If you’re uncomfortable with monthly support, there’s also PayPal, some crypto addresses, and a store.
Just know that the Patreon page is where all supporter benefits, like early releases, are organized and published.
