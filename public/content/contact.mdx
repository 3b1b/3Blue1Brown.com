Under the standard YouTube license, you are free to embed the videos in your own site or blog, as long as it is not behind a paywall.

If you want to use some of the visuals offline for classroom usage or a
presentation, feel free to do so. In both cases, attribution is of course appreciated.

Otherwise, to reupload the content in any way, e.g. incorporating them into a video, or uploading them to a new video platform, you will need to purchase a license. If you'd like to do so, kindly fill out the form below.
