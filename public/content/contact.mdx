# Contact

Please note the [FAQs](/faq) above before writing in. They address, for example, questions about [animation code](/faq#manim), [topic requests](/faq#request), [questions about math](/faq#math-question), and more. If you're asking about a particular video, check to see if your question has already been answered in that video's description.

## Licensing inquiry

Under the standard YouTube license, you are free to embed the videos in your own site or blog, as long as it is not behind a paywall.

If you want to use some of the visuals offline for classroom usage or a
presentation, feel free to do so. In both cases, attribution is of course appreciated.

Otherwise, to reupload the content in any way, e.g. incorporating them into a video, or uploading them to a new video platform, you will need to purchase a license. If you'd like to do so, kindly fill out the form below.

## Speaking request

While I do occasionally speak at schools and corporate events, it's worth mentioning that the main focus will always be the videos, so talks are typically kept to a minimum.
