## A message from Grant

The one thing that stands out when I chat with people from Janestreet is how positively they feel about their culture and coworkers. It reminds me more of a close-knit group of grad students than anything else. Many there stay engaged with pure math (I was pleasantly surprised to learn they even produced a [real analysis course](https://www.janestreet.com/real-numbers/)), and everyone clearly loves [nerdy puzzles](https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/). The way one friend phrased it to me is that their optimal hire seems to be someone who participated in the USAMO, or has some similarly demanding mathematical background, and wants a job where they can apply that kind of thinking. They have very high hiring standards, but one thing that translates to is a clear mutual respect among the people working there.

Also, for the undergrads among you, they have a very strong internship program.

## (Materials from Janestreet)

(To be added: Any materials from the Janestreet team relevant to enticing the kind of tech nerds we're looking for, and conveying what it would be like to work there. Because the [culture page](https://www.janestreet.com/culture/) already does this so well, what might be most effective is to simply link to that, while pulling out a few salient parts relevant to the 3b1b audience.)
