## A message from Grant

I had the good fortune of spending a day at the Figma offices a little while ago. Some of my former Khan Academy coworkers had started working there, and since it’s a product I use all the time, I was curious to see what it was like from the inside. One thing that became abundantly clear, even after the first hour, was how jovial and fun the culture is. I could be biased, because I happened to be there on the day of a company-wide talent show[^1], but let’s just say this was clearly one of those companies where the employees are genuinely friends with each other, not merely acquaintances.

On a deeper level, it was fascinating to hear about how significant the technical challenges of the product are. Simply creating good design software can be deceptively tricky on its own, but now add to that the need for it to scale gracefully for very large documents, to run in the browser, to allow multiple users to edit a document at once, _and_ to account for some of those users being offline at times. Any engineer will agree it’s actually highly nontrivial. The team clearly approaches all these challenges very thoughtfully, and values clear communication. Take a look at some of their engineering blog posts I’ve highlighted below to get some glimpse of this yourself.

## (Materials from Figma)

To be added: Any materials from the Figma team relevant to enticing the kind of tech nerds we're looking for, and conveying what it would be like to work there. For instance,

- Links to selected blog posts, say from Evan Wallace, describing some of the technical challenges faced while building Figma.
- Employee testimonials
- Any puzzles the 3blue1brown audience may enjoy, relevant to engineering work at Figma.
