## A message from Grant

I had the good fortune of spending a day at the Figma offices a few years ago. Some of my former Khan Academy coworkers had started working there, and since it’s a product I use all the time, I was curious to see what it was like from the inside. One thing that became abundantly clear, even after the first hour, was how jovial and fun the culture is. I could be biased, because I happened to be there on the day of a company-wide talent show[^1], but let’s just say this was clearly one of those companies where the employees are genuinely friends with each other, not merely acquaintances.

On a deeper level, I was a bit surprised at how significant the technical challenges of the product are. Simply creating good design software can be deceptively tricky on its own, but add to that the need for it to scale gracefully for very large documents, to run in the browser, to allow multiple users edit a document at once, with potential for some editing offline, and any engineer will agree it’s actually highly nontrivial. The team clearly approaches all these challenges very thoughtfully, and values clear communication. Take a look at some of their engineering blog posts I’ve highlighted below to get some glimpse of this yourself.
