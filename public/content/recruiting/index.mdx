# Career connect

3Blue1Brown has several partnerships with companies who are interested in hiring the kinds of math enthusiasts who find joy in these lessons, and who spend their free time learning about technical topics.

Whether you're a new graduate, a student looking for an internship, or a seasoned professional open to changing companies, each of the groups below is one that I feel confident in recommending. I've only included companies where I could see myself working in another life, either because of the company culture, the overall mission, how interesting their technical challenges are, or some combination of all three.

If you represent a company that wishes to recruit through 3Blue1Brown, please reach out to us at careerconnect@3blue1brown.com.  If you successfully find a job through this please, we'd love to hear from you too.
