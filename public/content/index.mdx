Instead of funding these videos through sponsored ad reads at the end of each one, or separating out some behind a paywall, they're funded directly through viewer support.

If they add value to your life, it would mean a lot if you considered joining the supporting members. Benefits range from early access to new videos, to having your name in the video credits.
