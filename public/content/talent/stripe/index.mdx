## The Culture at Stripe 
When we talked with the engineering team at Stripe, one word kept coming up: exothermic. It’s their shorthand for the kind of person who is naturally warm, collaborative, and personable. It’s not just about being "nice"; it's about the ability to take a complex, "big brain" problem—like the intricate logic of global subscription services—and explain it with simple, infectious enthusiasm.

At Stripe, the internal tagline is "Crafting Beauty." You’ll see it on their sweatshirts and stickers, but you see it most clearly in their work. Whether they are navigating the huge number of different tax jurisdictions in the US or refining their payment API, there is a deep-seated respect for the craft. It’s a place where engineers genuinely "nerd out" over API design because they care about the elegance of the solution as much as the function.

We love that their culture is seniority-agnostic. They aren't looking for a specific number of years on a resume; they are looking for people who are humble, proactive, and stay curious long after the structure of a classroom is gone. Their interview process reflects this pragmatic spirit: instead of an abstract coding puzzle, you might find yourself debugging a real repo. They don’t just want to see how many bugs you can squash—they want to see how simply and beautifully you can do it.
