## A message from Grant

For a long time, I've had a deep respect for the two brothers who founded Stripe, Patrick and John Collison. By extension, I've been very interested in the company they've built. The first interaction I had with them was when I was in college, when I happened to live in the appartment below Patrick and John's during a summer internship I had in SF. They kindly had my roommates and me over for lunch at the office one afternoon, and even in one conversation, the unusual level of technical competence mixed with wry Irish humor makes a lasting impression. In the times that we've crossed paths since then, that impression has only strengthened.

Recently, I sat down to chat with a few members of the engineering team, and one of the most charming things about that conversation was how much respect they all had for one another. As I asked about company culture, a few common words came up repeatedly as people described their coworkers, including "curiosity", "humility", and, a bit more unusually, "exothermic". I'm guessing this is a Collison-ism that bled its way into the company vernacular; what they're getting at is that people add energy rather than taking it away during conversations and collaborations.

There were a number of other funny phrases they used multiple times, the kind of phrases that would sound like hollow corporate buzzwords except that they were coming from a set of engineers who really meant them sincerely. In one long discussion about how good API design is an underappreciated technical challenge, and they would smile and say, unironically, that they try to bring "craft and beauty" to each API they create. Those same two words echoed thereafter in the conversation as a mainstay for how each engineer described what they were aiming for.

The other common point of emphasis was pragmatism. One of them highlighted how he appreciated that in interviews, instead of doing a whiteboard problem or a toy coding example, he had just been given a repo to clone and was told to debug it. Instead of finding the problems in the world that seem prettiest, they start with the ones that are important, even if that means being intrinsically messy, and trying to bring, well, craft and beauty to smoothing out that messiness as much as is possible.
