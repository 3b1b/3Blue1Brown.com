Prime Academics is founder-led by a career math tutor, and as a result, the firm is widely known specifically for its math expertise, even as we tutor across all subjects. Families nationwide seek us out for our deep familiarity with rigorous math curricula and our ability to deliver a rare blend of high-level technical math expertise and exceptionally high touch service. We hire selectively and treat tutors as professionals -- trusted with autonomy, judgment, and meaningful multi-year student relationships.

Prime is a strong fit for exceptional math educators who want to do fewer sessions at a higher level, and who are willing to go above and beyond, both during and outside of sessions, to ensure their students are fully equipped to succeed.

## Testimonials

> Working with Prime Academics has been a milestone achievement in my career. The students that we get are phenomenal. They are some of the most driven and eager to learn kids that I have ever seen. Even when they struggle, their tenacity is seriously impressive. As a Prime tutor, the math that we tackle with our students is very intellectually stimulating. It can and will make you rethink what you believe to already know, and it will allow you to see aspects of geometry, algebra, and precalculus with a new appreciation. Lastly, there is the team behind it all. Tutors are always willing to jump in and provide their unique expertise for our students.

> I've been working with Prime for nearly two years, and it's been a genuinely positive, rewarding experience. The students are motivated and high-achieving, and many are excited to engage deeply with math rather than just chase answers. I've especially enjoyed working on Exeter-style problems that reward curiosity, exploration and creative thinking, alongside more traditional SAT prep work. Prime and Alex do an excellent job of matching tutors with students, and the support from the team makes it easy to collaborate when multiple tutors are involved. It's a well-run organization that respects tutors' time and expertise.
