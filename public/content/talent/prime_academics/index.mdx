Prime is a strong fit for exceptional math educators who want to do fewer sessions at a higher level, and who are willing to go above and beyond, both during and outside of sessions, to ensure their students are fully equipped to succeed.

## Puzzles

Here are two problems we wanted to share, which we think 3blue1brown viewers will enjoy. As a tutor, your challenge is not simply to find the answer, but to be nimble enough to adapt to multiple approaches on the fly.

> **Puzzle 1:** The minute hand on a watch is 10 mm long and the hour hand is 5 mm long. How fast is the distance between the tips of the hands changing at one o'clock?

> **Puzzle 2:** Demonstrate three separate methods for answering this question: The area of a trapezoid is 9,000 square units. The parallel sides have lengths 50 and 150. The diagonals of the trapezoid divide it into four triangles. Find the areas of these four triangles.

If you not only enjoy solving this kind of question but also understanding every possible approach someone might take, you will thrive here.

## Testimonials

> Working with Prime Academics has been a milestone achievement in my career. The students that we get are phenomenal. They are some of the most driven and eager to learn kids that I have ever seen. Even when they struggle, their tenacity is seriously impressive. As a Prime tutor, the math that we tackle with our students is very intellectually stimulating. It can and will make you rethink what you believe to already know, and it will allow you to see aspects of geometry, algebra, and precalculus with a new appreciation. Lastly, there is the team behind it all. Tutors are always willing to jump in and provide their unique expertise for our students.

> I've been working with Prime for nearly two years, and it's been a genuinely positive, rewarding experience. The students are motivated and high-achieving, and many are excited to engage deeply with math rather than just chase answers. I've especially enjoyed working on Exeter-style problems that reward curiosity, exploration and creative thinking, alongside more traditional SAT prep work. Prime and Alex do an excellent job of matching tutors with students, and the support from the team makes it easy to collaborate when multiple tutors are involved. It's a well-run organization that respects tutors' time and expertise.
