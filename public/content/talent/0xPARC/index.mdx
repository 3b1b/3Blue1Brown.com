## Puzzles

These puzzles were put together by 0xPARC's Holden Mui, for the 3blue1brown audience. If these kinds of problems are up you're alley, consider reaching out to learn more!

**Problem 1 (TST 2018/4):**
Suppose you have many black-box majority functions on three binary
inputs. Is it possible to chain them to construct a majority function on 2025 binary inputs? (You
can duplicate inputs and outputs of the black-box function for free.)

**Problem 2 (homomorphic FFT).**
The CKKS fully homomorphic encryption scheme gives a way to encrypt vectors in ${C}^{32{,}768}$ such that anyone can add encrypted vectors elementwise, multiply encrypted vectors elementwise, or “rotate” ciphertexts $\left(z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_{65536}\right) \mapsto\left(z_i, z_{i+1}, \ldots, z_{i-1}\right)$ by any "offset" $i$. Suppose that:

- encrypted addition takes 4 microseconds
- encrypted multiplication takes 5600 microseconds
- encrypted rotation takes 6100 microseconds

Find a fast arithmetic circuit that computes the Fourier transform on an encrypted vector, conditioned
on the multiplicative depth of the circuit being at most three.

**Problem 3.**
Are there any nontrivial solutions to the system of equations

$$
\begin{aligned}
a+b+c+d & \equiv 0 \quad(\bmod p) \\
a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2 & \equiv 0 \quad(\bmod p) \\
a^3+b^3+c^3+d^3 & \equiv 0 \quad(\bmod p)
\end{aligned}
$$

for $p=2^{127} - 1$?

**Problem 4 (zero-knowledge factorization).**
The programming language circom allows users to prove that they have an assignment to a set of variables satisfying a system of quadratic constraints

$$
\begin{aligned}
(\text{lin. comb. of vars}) \times (\text{lin. comb. of vars}) &\equiv (\text{lin. comb. of vars}) \quad (\bmod p) \\
(\text{lin. comb. of vars}) \times (\text{lin. comb. of vars}) &\equiv (\text{lin. comb. of vars}) \quad (\bmod p) \\
&\vdots \\
(\text{lin. comb. of vars}) \times (\text{lin. comb. of vars}) &\equiv (\text{lin. comb. of vars}) \quad (\bmod p) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

without revealing the complete assignment of variables[^1].
Some of the variables are set to be public, Some of the variables are set to be public, and the rest are set to be private

(a) Give a system of quadratic constraints in private variables $x, s_1, s_2, s_3, \ldots$ that has a satisfying solution if and only if $x \in\left\{0,1, \ldots, 2^{64}-1\right\}$.

(b) Give a system of quadratic constraints in private variables $x, s_1, s_2, s_3, \ldots$ that has a satisfying solution if and only if $r \ne 1$.

(c) Give a system of quadratic constraints in one public variable $n \in\left\{2,3, \ldots, 2^{64}-1\right\}$ and private variables $s_1, s_2, s_3, \ldots$ such that finding a satisfying solution to the system of quadratic constraints is equivalent to finding a nontrivial factorization of $n$.

(d) Give a system of quadratic constraints in 64 public variables $\ell_0, \ell_1, \ldots, \ell_{63} \in\left\{0,1, \ldots, 2^{64}-1\right\}$ and private variables $s_1, s_2, s_3, \ldots$ such that finding a satisfying solution to the system of quadratic constraints is equivalent to finding a nontrivial factorization of $\ell_0+2^{64} \ell_1+2^{128} \ell_2+ \cdots+2^{4032} \ell_{63}$.
