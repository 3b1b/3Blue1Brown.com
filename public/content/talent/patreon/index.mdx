At Patreon, we spend every day building toward a future where creators are in control and real community thrives. It’s a future where creators can make what excites them most without having to worry about feeding an unpredictable, ever-changing algorithm. And it’s a future where fans and creators have a direct line of access to one another, with nothing standing in between.

For members of the 3blue1brown audience interested in the technical work that goes into making this happen, take a look at our [engineering blog](https://www.patreon.com/cw/engineering). There, we've outlined challenges from [how we scaled for live events](https://www.patreon.com/posts/from-thundering-141679975), to [how to use asyc agnostic decorators in Python](https://www.patreon.com/posts/how-to-use-async-124658443), and many more.

To understand our vision for empowering creators, and creating a better environment for engaging with content on the internet, see our founder Jack Conte's recent NYT OpED video.

## Message from Grant

Regular viewers of the channel will not be surprised to learn that Patreon is near and dear to my heart. Given the core role it has played in my channel for so many years, I've had a few occasions to visit the offices and get to know the team a bit. One thing that stands out in spending a day at their offices is the general environment of kindness and warmth. Many companies speak of "mission", but only in a rare few do you feel that the word carries real meaning when you talk to employees. Patreon is one of those.

Most recently, I was talking to their VP of product and learned that he originally joined the company after hearing me mention Patreon in a video many, many years ago. He decided to explore it more, ended up joining, and has loved it ever since. I was also charmed to see on their careers page that the cofounder and CTO chose to highlight his membership of 3blue1brown. I bring this up to you, someone who has presumably landed on this page as a 3blue1brown follower, simply to highlight that you would clearly find like-minded colleagues working at Patreon.
