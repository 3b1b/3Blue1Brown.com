Patreon is a media and community platform where over 300,000 creators give their biggest fans access to exclusive work and experiences. We offer creators a variety of ways to engage with their fans and build a lasting business including: paid memberships, free memberships, community chats, live video, and selling to fans directly with one-time purchases. Ultimately our goal is simple: fund the creative class. And we're leaders in that space, with: $10 billion+ generated by creators since Patreon's inception, 100 million+ free memberships, and 25 million+ paid memberships on Patreon today.

## Our technical work

As members of the 3blue1brown audience, you will likely be interested in the technical work that goes into enabling our platform. On our [engineering blog](https://www.patreon.com/cw/engineering), our engineering team shares insights, stories, and lessons learned as we build and scale Patreon. From infrastructure challenges and product innovations to best practices and open-source contributions, this blog is where we document our projects and give you a behind-the-scenes look at what we're working on. Whether you're a developer, engineer, or simply curious about how Patreon works under the hood, we invite you to explore, learn, and connect with us.

As a software engineer on Patreon’s Creator Acquisition team, I work on the Audience Migration system that helps creators seamlessly bring their fans—free and paid—from other platforms onto Patreon. Building this system is uniquely challenging due to the scale, the variety of edge cases, and the need to precisely map external memberships into Patreon’s ecosystem without disrupting fans’ existing access. One of the most rewarding parts of the work is designing systems that transfer remaining paid access automatically, so fans never have to double-pay or intervene. We built the migration backend as a carefully orchestrated state machine, balancing correctness, transparency, and resilience across every step of the workflow. It’s been a deeply collaborative and technically complex project, and I’m proud to work on systems that directly help creators grow and thrive on Patreon.

At Patreon, I get to work on products that combine deep technical challenges with real creator impact. Most recently, I worked on Patreon Live - creating a new livestream system from the ground up and coordinating video, chat, and complex state management across a large synchronous system. I love that the work is both technically deep and collaborative, and that we continue evolving Live by quickly shipping creator-requested features like Chat Replay and Ticketed Lives, shaping how creators connect with their fans in real time.

Working at Patreon is uniquely fulfilling because the work we do directly supports creators and their ability to build sustainable businesses. I get to solve challenging technical problems at real scale while collaborating with thoughtful, mission-driven teammates who genuinely care about the impact of what we ship. The combination of technical depth, ownership, and clear purpose makes the work here especially rewarding.

As a machine learning engineer at Patreon, my work is focused on helping keep the platform safe. That means thinking carefully about how the systems we build affect millions of users, and considering their impact at scale. For me, safety work is as much about stewardship as it is about detection. Rather than being purely punitive, the ML systems we design can gently nudge behavior through thoughtful in-product prompts that encourage people to pause and reconsider harmful content — helping keep online spaces healthier, more thoughtful, and more meaningful.

## Message from Grant

Regular viewers of the channel will not be surprised to learn that Patreon is near and dear to my heart. I can speak to the effect is has on the creator community, as it has long been a vital part of how I've been able to make a career out of producing educational videos.

I've had a few occasions to visit the offices and get to know a few members of the team. One thing that stands out in spending a day at their offices is the general environment of kindness and warmth. Many companies speak of "mission", but only in a rare few do you feel that the word carries real meaning when you talk to employees. Patreon is one of those.

Most recently, I was talking to their VP of product and learned that he originally joined the company after hearing me mention Patreon in a video many, many years ago. He decided to explore it more, ended up joining, and has loved it ever since. I was also charmed to see on their careers page that the cofounder and CTO chose to highlight his membership of 3blue1brown. I bring this up to you, someone who has presumably landed on this page as a 3blue1brown follower, simply to highlight that you would clearly find like-minded colleagues working at Patreon.
