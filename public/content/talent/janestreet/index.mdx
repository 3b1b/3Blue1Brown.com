## A culture of problem-solving

At Jane Street, solving puzzles is intrinsic to the work we do every day. Exchanging logic and number puzzles with each other not only reflects our shared sense of fun, but we have found that the kind of creativity and problem-solving required to approach these maps well onto the skillsets required to thrive here.

Here are a few examples of the kinds of problems we love, and which expect the 3blue1brown audience will love too. You can find even more on our [puzzles page](https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/).

This significance of puzzles to our culture is even baked into the logo. Can you see how?

<!-- Inspired by the Bombe device used to decipher encrypted messages during WWII, we created a circular alphabet. Based on this system, we crafted a primary mark that reads “JSC” (for Jane Street Capital).

  <TestimonialCard text="There's nothing in the open literature that is close to what we are doing. When you do find things that work, you really do feel that you're actually on the frontier—you might be the first person in the world to figure these things out." attribution="Fan Pu, Machine Learning" />
  <TestimonialCard text="Everybody here is a math nerd. If you go up to someone and start explaining an interesting math puzzle—the first thing they'll do is stop you before you can tell them how to solve the puzzle because they want to try it on their own." attribution="Jane, Trading" />
  <TestimonialCard text="Qualities that we really value here at Jane Street are curiosity and humbleness---that allows us to have a very open culture." attribution="Andreas, Sales & Trading" />
  <TestimonialCard text="There's a wide variety of people—from kernel developers thinking about deep technical details for GPU performance, to people who think purely about math and apply that to our machine learning problems." attribution="Corwin, Machine Learning" />

## Message from Grant

Over the years, I've had a number of occasions to interact with the folks at Jane Street. Obviously, everyone there is very smart, which is well-known at this point, but what really stood out to me is how genuinely enthusiastic the people there are about education and learning.

Years ago I remember being told about a series of lessons they produced called [Real Numbers](https://www.janestreet.com/real-numbers/explore/), teaching foundational topics such as probability (through a puzzle-solving lens, no surprises there!). At first, I thought "Huh, that's neat, but kind of a strange thing for such a company to do". The more people I talked to, though, the less strange that seemed. Another one I met turned out to have coauthored one of my favorite books introducing contest-style problem-solving when I was younger. Yet another had just returned from a few years' break she had taken for Jane Street to finish her PhD in number theory, simply because that was always something she had deeply valued and loved.
