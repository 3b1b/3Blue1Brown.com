## Frontier research for quantitative trading

We’re building a truly AI-driven trading firm, rooted in frontier research and deep market expertise. You’ll join a close-knit group of brilliant, supportive colleagues and harness tens of thousands of GPUs, petabytes of training data, and billions in trading capital. If sharing ideas in a high trust environment with lots of autonomy and minimal hierarchy sounds good to you, reach out!


## A culture of problem solving

At Jane Street, solving puzzles is intrinsic to the work we do every day. Exchanging logic and number puzzles with each other not only reflects our shared sense of fun, but we have found that the kind of creativity and problem-solving required to approach these maps well onto the skillsets required to thrive here.

Here are a few examples of the kinds of problems we love, and which expect the 3blue1brown audience will love too. You can find even more on our [puzzles page](https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/).

## About careers at Jane Street

As both a trading firm and a tech firm, we have room for people who love to trade, people who love to program, and people everywhere in between. Nearly all of our traders write code, and many of our software engineers trade. The role you carve out for yourself will be largely dependent on your strengths and the types of problems you enjoy thinking about.

If you’ve never thought about a career in finance, you’re in good company. Many of us were in the same position before working here. If you have a curious mind and a passion for solving interesting problems, we have a feeling you’ll fit right in.

### Machine Learning/Trading/Quantitative Research

On our Machine Learning team, you'll build the deep learning models that power our trading strategies, supported by our rapidly growing computing cluster with thousands of high-end GPUs. Trading poses unusual challenges—large models and nonstationary datasets in a competitive multi-agent environment—that force us to search for novel techniques.

Our researchers and ML specialists develop novel models and approaches, implementing them in code to form the core of our systematic models. They analyze large datasets using a variety of machine learning techniques, exploring the latest theory and pushing beyond existing performance limits. Their research tackles problems ranging from sub-microsecond trading to uncovering long-term market inefficiencies across trillions of historic events.

Traders focus on enhancing these models, analyzing their performance, and identifying new opportunities for optimization and automation. While some opportunities require rapid decision-making, the majority of our trading is fully automated.

  <TestimonialCard text="There's nothing in the open literature that is close to what we are doing. When you do find things that work, you really do feel that you're actually on the frontier—you might be the first person in the world to figure these things out." attribution="Fan Pu, Machine Learning" />
  <TestimonialCard text="Everybody here is a math nerd. If you go up to someone and start explaining an interesting math puzzle—the first thing they'll do is stop you before you can tell them how to solve the puzzle because they want to try it on their own." attribution="Jane, Trading" />
  <TestimonialCard text="Qualities that we really value here at Jane Street are curiosity and humbleness---that allows us to have a very open culture." attribution="Andreas, Sales & Trading" />
  <TestimonialCard text="There's a wide variety of people—from kernel developers thinking about deep technical details for GPU performance, to people who think purely about math and apply that to our machine learning problems." attribution="Corwin, Machine Learning" />

## Message from Grant

Over the years, I've had a number of occasions to interact with the folks at Jane Street. Obviously, everyone there is very smart, which is well-known at this point, but what really stood out to me is how genuinely enthusiastic the people there are about education and learning.

Years ago I remember being told about a series of lessons they produced called [Real Numbers](https://www.janestreet.com/real-numbers/explore/), teaching foundational topics such as probability (through a puzzle-solving lens, no surprises there!). At first, I thought "Huh, that's neat, but kind of a strange thing for such a company to do". The more people I talked to, though, the less strange that seemed. Another one I met turned out to have coauthored one of my favorite books introducing contest-style problem-solving when I was younger. Yet another had just returned from a few years' break she had taken for Jane Street to finish her PhD in number theory, simply because that was always something she had deeply valued and loved.
