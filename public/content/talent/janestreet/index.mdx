## A culture of problem-solving

At Jane Street, solving puzzles is intrinsic to the work we do every day. Exchanging logic and number puzzles with each other not only reflects our shared sense of fun, but we have found that the kind of creativity and problem-solving required to approach these maps well onto the skillsets required to thrive here.

Here are a few examples of the kinds of problems we love, and which expect the 3blue1brown audience will love too. You can find even more on our [puzzles page](https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/).

This significance of puzzles to our culture is even baked into the logo. Inspired by the Bombe device used to decipher encrypted messages during WWII, we created a circular alphabet. Based on this system, we crafted a primary mark that reads “JSC” (for Jane Street Capital).

## Message from Grant

Over the years, I've had a number of occasions to interact with the folks at Jane Street. Obviously, everyone there is very smart, which is well-known at this point, but what really stood out to me is how genuinely enthusiastic the people there are about education and learning.

Years ago I remember being told about a series of lessons they produced called [Real Numbers](https://www.janestreet.com/real-numbers/explore/), teaching foundational topics such as probability (through a puzzle-solving lens, no surprises there!). At first, I thought "Huh, that's neat, but kind of a strange thing for such a company to do". The more people I talked to, though, the less strange that seemed. Another one I met turned out to have coauthored one of my favorite books introducing contest-style problem-solving when I was younger. Yet another had just returned from a few years' break she had taken for Jane Street to finish her PhD in number theory, simply because that was always something she had deeply valued and loved.
