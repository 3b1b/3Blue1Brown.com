## Frontier research for quantitative trading

We’re building a truly AI-driven trading firm, rooted in frontier research and deep market expertise. You’ll join a close-knit group of brilliant, supportive colleagues, harnessing tens of thousands of GPUs, petabytes of training data, and billions in trading capital. If sharing ideas in a high trust environment with lots of autonomy and minimal hierarchy sounds good to you, reach out!

## A culture of problem solving

At Jane Street, puzzles aren't just a pastime. We find puzzles to solve in everything we do, from building models for machine learning to analyzing complex trading scenarios. Of course, we do puzzles for fun too! Here are a few examples of the kinds of problems we love, and you can find more on our [puzzles page](https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/).

## Your career at Jane Street

What do you want to be when you grow up? At Jane Street, you don't have to choose. Traders write code. Engineers build models. Researchers make markets. The boundaries between disciplines aren't just blurry, they're optional. And with growth and change at the core of our approach, you're not hired for a role, but for a trajectory.

If you’ve never thought about a career in finance, you’re in good company. Many of us were in the same position before working here. If you have a curious mind and a passion for solving interesting problems, you’ll fit right in.

### Machine Learning/Trading/Quantitative Research

On our Machine Learning team, you'll build the deep learning models that power our trading strategies, supported by thousands of high-end GPUs. Financial markets pose unique challenges for machine learning: extreme noise, nonstationarity, and a competitive multi-agent environment. Our researchers have to be up on the latest developments in the field, as well as pursuing novel techniques.

Our ML researchers and engineers work across a range of timescales and problem types, from probing microstructure dynamics at sub-microsecond resolution to uncovering persistent inefficiencies buried in trillions of historical events. Research systems must support constant development and innovation, and trading systems must perform inference and execute trades at blistering speeds.

Traders wear a lot of hats: they build machine learning models, analyze market dynamics and risk, seek out new businesses, identify what to optimize or automate next. Most of Jane Street's trading is fully automated, though some opportunities still call for rapid human decision-making.

## Message from Grant

Over the years, I've had a number of occasions to interact with the folks at Jane Street. Obviously, everyone there is very smart, which is well-known at this point, but what really stood out to me is how genuinely enthusiastic the people there are about education and learning.

Years ago I remember being told about a series of lessons they produced called [Real Numbers](https://www.janestreet.com/real-numbers/explore/), teaching foundational topics such as probability (through a puzzle-solving lens, no surprises there!). At first, I thought "Huh, that's neat, but kind of a strange thing for such a company to do". The more people I talked to, though, the less strange that seemed. Another one I met turned out to have coauthored one of my favorite books introducing contest-style problem-solving when I was younger. Yet another had just returned from a few years' break she had taken for Jane Street to finish her PhD in number theory, simply because that was always something she had deeply valued and loved.
