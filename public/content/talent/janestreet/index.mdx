## The Story Behind the Logo

The team at Jane Street is passionate about solving puzzles and cracking codes. So it made sense to create a logo that contains a hidden message. Inspired by the Bombe device used to decipher encrypted messages during WWII, we created a circular alphabet. Based on this system, we crafted a primary mark that reads “JSC” (for Jane Street Capital). This circular alphabet can be used to spell pretty much anything by shifting the gaps in the circles.
