## (Materials from Janestreet)

(To be added: Any materials from the Janestreet team relevant to enticing the kind of tech nerds we're looking for, and conveying what it would be like to work there. Because the [culture page](https://www.janestreet.com/culture/) already does this so well, what might be most effective is to simply link to that, while pulling out a few salient parts relevant to the 3b1b audience.)
