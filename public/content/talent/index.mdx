Think of this as a virtual career fair. The partnered organizations below have open positions, are actively recruiting, and are interested in the kinds of technically curious people who watch 3blue1brown. Each featured page is like a booth at this fair, where they have chosen to share something they specifically believe this audience will enjoy, and which reflects their technical culture.

Note, each organization is a paid partner. I make sure to vet them, with a focus on whether members the technical staff genuinely enjoy their job, but you should always feel encouraged to do your own research.
