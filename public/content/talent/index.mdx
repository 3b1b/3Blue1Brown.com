Think of this as a virtual career fair. The partnered organizations below are interested in hiring the kinds of technically curious people who watch 3blue1brown. Each featured page is like a booth at this fair, where partners have chosen to share something they believe this audience will enjoy, and which reflects their technical culture.

_Note, these are sponsored positions. We make sure to vet them, and we are selective, but you should always feel encouraged to do your own research about any organization you might apply to._
