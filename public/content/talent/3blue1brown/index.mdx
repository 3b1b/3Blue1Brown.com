## Because why not set up a booth at my own career fair?

The main roles I'm looking for right now center around visuals. For one, I would like someone to help with the core visualizations of the math covered. This very-likely means someone who is fluent with manim, but I'm open-minded to considering people very skilled with other tools and workflows that lend themselves to precise mathematical illustration.

I would also like to expand the visual scope of the channel to include more hand-drawn illustrations to bring to life the more narrative aspects of a given lesson. I have done this to some extent in the past, with contractors, but I have an appetite for more of it. This is especially true for a few specific projects on my queue with a more narrative and historical focus.

In both cases, what I care most about is your past work. If you are a good fit, these should be relatively quick applications to fill out.

### Translators


### Other roles

A lot of people, mostly students, will write in to ask if I have positions for a writer/researcher.
