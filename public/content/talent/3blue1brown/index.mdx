# Because why not set up a booth at my own career fair?

## Visuals

A huge amount of effort for this channel goes into the visuals, so the first role I'm looking for is someone who can complement my own work in creating core visualizations for the math covered. This very likely means someone who is fluent with manim, but I'm open-minded to considering people very skilled with other tools and workflows that lend themselves to precise mathematical illustration.

I would also like to expand the visual scope of the channel to include more hand-drawn illustrations to bring to life the more narrative aspects of a given lesson. I have done this to some extent in the past, on a contract basis, but I have an appetite for more of it. This is especially true for a few specific projects on my queue with a more narrative and historical focus.

For both these roles, what I care most about is your past work. If you are a good fit, these should be relatively quick applications to fill out.

### Translators

The two usual options for adding translated audio tracks to videos are AI dubs and professional studios. I've opted to go for a third route and hire independent translators directly. My aim is for translations to sound true to the spirit of an independent YouTube channel, where the person speaking genuinely knows and cares about the material being discussed.

For example, I care less about a translator having neutral dialect (so long as they are intelligible to general speakers) than I do about their underlying proficiency and passion for the subject matter coming through in their voice, in much the same way that I'd rather watch a YouTuber with a thick scottish accent who is engaging and passionate about the material than professional news broadcaster with a more standard accent.

Having high-quality audio is important, as is the ability to narrate well.

In 2025, I began this process for translation with a small set of languages, and now have a trusted set of translators in a few languages (including Spanish, French, Portuguese, Hindi, and Russian). Here I'm opening the application to add a few more languages. The current priorities are Arabic, Korean, and Vietnamese, but we are open to other languages for highly compelling candidates.

_Note, if you would like to contribute subtitles, we have an open platform here accepting edits to text translations. If you don't see your language there, send us a message and we'll get it added.__

### Other roles

A lot of people, mostly students, will write in to ask if I have positions for a writer/researcher.

However, I have no illusions that my own ideas are the best, and I fully recognize the value in collaboration. If you have a vision for a particular video, I do have a form to accept pitches. If I choose to take it up, I will happily offer fair compensation to you as a freelance co-author of the piece.

It's important to emphasize, though, that the number of topics I would love to cover is vast, and it grows at a rate greatly exceeding the current ability to produce them, so in almost all cases, I simply will not be able to take it on. I can promise that these pitches will be reviewed at least once per month.
