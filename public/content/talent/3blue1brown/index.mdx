# Because why not make a booth at my own career fair?

## Visuals

A huge amount of effort for this channel goes into the visuals. I'm looking for is someone who can complement my own work in creating core visualizations for the math covered. This very likely means someone who is fluent with manim, so that you can carry the torch on my innitial work and vice versa, but I'm open-minded to considering people very skilled with other tools and workflows that lend themselves to precise mathematical illustration.

I would also like to expand the visual scope of the channel to include more hand-drawn illustrations that bring to life the more narrative aspects of a given lesson. I have done this to some extent in the past, on a contract basis, but I have an appetite for more. This is especially true for a few specific projects on my queue with a more narrative and historical focus.

For both these roles, what I care most about is your past work. If you are a good fit, these should be relatively quick applications to fill out.

### Translators

The two common options for adding translated audio tracks to videos are AI dubs and professional studios. I've opted to go for a third route and hire independent translators directly. My aim is for translations to sound true to the spirit of an independent YouTube channel, where the person speaking genuinely knows and cares about the material being discussed.

For example, I care less about a translator having neutral dialect (so long as they are intelligible to general speakers) than I do about their underlying proficiency and passion for the subject coming through in their voice. This is for the same reason that I'd rather watch a YouTuber with a thick scottish accent who is engaging and passionate about the material than professional news broadcaster with a more standard accent clearly reading from a teleprompter.

That said, independent does not mean unprofessional. Having high-quality audio is important, as is the ability to narrate well.

In 2025, I began this process for translation with a small set of languages, and now have a trusted set of translators in a few languages (including Spanish, French, Portuguese, Hindi, and Russian). We still have a ways to go before everything is translated, but we're making good headway.

Here I'm opening the application to add a few more languages to the effort. The current priorities are Arabic, Korean, and Vietnamese, but we are open to other languages for highly compelling candidates.

_Note, if you would like to contribute subtitles, we have an [open platform](https://criblate.com/) here accepting edits to text translations. If you don't see your language there, [send us a message](/faq#contact) and we'll get it added._

### Topic pitches

A lot of people, mostly students, write in to ask if I have positions for a writer/researcher. That is not something I'm actively hiring for. Partly, this is because I still see 3blue1brown as a personal project, not as a production studio, and partly, it's because writing is simply not the rate-limiter.

That said, I have no illusions that my own ideas are the best, and I fully recognize the value in collaboration. If you have a vision for a particular video, I have put up a form to accept pitches. If I choose to take it up, I will happily offer fair compensation to you as a freelance co-author of the piece.

It's important to emphasize, though, that the number of topics I would love to cover is vast, and it grows at a rate greatly exceeding the current ability to produce them. So in most cases, I simply will not be able to take it on.
