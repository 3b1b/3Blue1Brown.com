The last several lessons have been about the idea of a derivative, and before moving on to integrals, I want to take some time to talk about limits.

To be honest, the idea of a limit is not really anything new. If you know what the word "approach" means you pretty much already know what a limit is, you could say the rest is a matter of assigning fancy notation to the intuitive idea of one value getting closer to another.

But there are a number of reasons to dive deeper into this topic.

For one thing it’s worth showing is how the way I’ve been describing derivatives so far lines up with the the formal definition of a derivative as it’s typically presented in most courses and textbooks.

I want to give you some confidence that thinking of terms like $dx$ and $df$ as concrete non-zero nudges is not just some trick for building intuition; it’s actually backed up by the formal definition of a derivative in all its rigor.

I also want to shed light on what exactly mathematicians mean by "approach", in terms of something called the "epsilon delta" definition of limits.

Then we’ll finish off with a clever trick for computing limits called L’Hopital’s rule.

## Formal Definition of the derivative

So first thing’s first, let’s take a look at the formal definition of the derivative.

As a reminder, when you have some function $f(x)$, to think about the derivative at a particular input, maybe $x=2$, you start by imagining nudging that input by some tiny $dx$, and looking at the resulting change to the output, $df$.

The ratio $df/dx$, which can nicely be thought of as the rise-over-run slope between the starting point on the graph and the nudged point, is almost the derivative. The actual derivative is whatever this ratio approaches as $dx$ approaches $0$.

Just to spell out what is meant here, that nudge to the output "$df$" is is the difference between $f$ at the starting-input plus $dx$ and $f$ at the starting-input; the change to the output caused by the nudge $dx$.

To express that you want to find what this ratio approaches as $dx$ approaches $0$, you write "l-i-m", for limit, with "$dx$ arrow $0$" below it.

Now, you’ll almost never see terms with a lowercase $d$, like $dx$, inside a limit like this. Instead the standard is to use a different variable, like $\Delta x$ (delta $x$), or commonly "$h$" for some reason.

The way I like to think of it is that terms with this lowercase $d$ in the typical derivative expression have built into them the idea of a limit, the idea that $dx$ is supposed to eventually approach $0$.

So in a sense this lefthand side "$df/dx$", the ratio we’ve been thinking about in the past lessons, is just shorthand for what the righthand side spells out in more detail, writing out exactly what we mean by $df$, and writing out the limiting process explicitly.

And that righthand side is the formal definition of a derivative, as you’d commonly see it in any calculus textbook.

### No infinitely small (rant)

Now, if you’ll pardon me for a small rant here, I want to emphasize that nothing about this righthand side references the paradoxical idea of an "infinitely small" change. The point of limits is to avoid that.

This value $h$ is the exact same thing as the "$dx$" I’ve been referencing throughout the series.

It’s a nudge to the input of $f$ with some non-zero, finitely small size, like $0.001$, it’s just that we’re analyzing what happens for arbitrarily small choices of $h$.

In fact, the only reason people introduce a new variable name into this formal definition, rather than just using $dx$, is to be super-extra clear that these changes to the input are ordinary numbers that have nothing to do with infinitesimals.

You see, there are others who like to interpret $dx$ as an "infinitely small change", whatever that would mean, or to just say that $dx$ and $df$ are nothing more than symbols that shouldn’t be taken too seriously.

But by now in the series, you know that I’m not really a fan of either of those views, I think you can and should interpret $dx$ as a concrete, finitely small nudge, just so long as you remember to ask what happens as it approaches $0$.

For one thing, and I hope the past few lessons have helped convince you of this, that helps to build a stronger intuition for where the rules of calculus actually come from.

But it’s not just some trick for building intuitions. Everything I’ve been saying about derivatives with this concrete-finitely-small-nudge philosophy is just a translation of the formal definition of derivatives.

Long story short, the big fuss about limits is that they let us avoid talking about infinitely small changes by instead asking what happens as the size of some change to our variable approaches $0$.

<!-- 

In multiple examples we have passed in small nudges to the input and expanded out the math to see how a function behaves. Remember when we dove into the algebraic guts of d(x^3)? At the time we considered what this ratio approaches as $dt$ approaches $0$. 

Example: setup derivative of $x^3$ using limit definition of derivative and exapand + evaluate.
