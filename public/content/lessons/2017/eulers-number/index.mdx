I’ve introduce a few derivative formulas, but a really important one I left out was exponentials. So here I want to talk about the derivatives of functions like $2^x$, $7^x$, and to show why $e^x$ is arguably the most important exponential.

## $2^x$ Population Mass

First of all, to get an intuition, let’s focus on the function $2^x$.

And let’s think of that input as a time, $t$, in days, and the output $2^t$ as a population size, perhaps of a particularly fertile band of pi creatures, which doubles every day.

Actually, instead of population size, which grows in discrete little jumps with each new baby pi creature, maybe let’s think of $2^t$ as the total mass of the population, which better reflects the continuity of this function $2^t$. At time $t=0$, the total mass $2^0=1$, for the mass of one creature. At $t = 1$ day, the population has grown to $2^1 = 2$ creatures masses. And day $t = 2$, it’s at $2^2 = 4$, and in general it keeps doubling every day.

<!-- TODO: graph highlight times 1, 2, 3, 4 -->

For the derivative, we want to find $\frac{dM}{dt}$, the rate at which this population mass is growing, thought of as a tiny change to mass divided by a tiny change in time. Let’s start by thinking of the rate of change over a full day, say between day 3 and day 4. In that case, it grows from 8 to 16, so that’s eight creatures masses added over the course of that day.

<Figure
  image="figures/population-mass-slope-1-and-2.svg" 
/>

<!-- Figure: slope  between 3 and 4 -->
Notice, that rate of growth equals the population size at the start of the day.

Between day $4$ and day $5$, it grows from $16$ to $32$, so that’s a rate of $16$ individuals per day, which again, is equal to the population size at the start of the day. And in general, the rate of growth over a full day always equals the population size at the start of that day.

So it might be tempting to say that this means the derivative of $2^t$ equals itself; that the rate of change of $2^t$ at a given time $t$ equals the value of $2^t$ itself. On the day when $2^t$ is $8$, the number of new creature-masses added per day is also $8$; on the day when $2^t$ is $16$, the number of new creature-masses added per day is also $16$.

This is definitely in the right direction, but it’s not quite correct. What we’re doing here is making comparisons over the course of a full day, considering the difference between 2t+1 and 2t.


But for the derivative, we need to ask about what happens for smaller and smaller changes. What’s the growth rate over an a tenth of a day...a hundredth of a day...one one billionth of a day, etc.


This is why I had us think of the function as representing population mass vs. time, since it makes sense to ask about a tiny change in mass over a tiny fraction of a day, but it doesn’t make as much sense to ask about the tiny change in the discrete population size per second.


More abstractly, for some tiny change in time dt, we want to understand the difference between 2t+dt and 2t, divided by dt. The change in the function per unit time, but now we’re looking very narrowly around a given point in time, rather than over the course of a full day.

And...here’s the thing. I would love if there was some clear geometric picture that made what’s about to follow just pop out. Some diagram where you could point to one value and say “see that part, that is the derivative of 2t”. If you know of one, please, let me know.

And while the goal here, as with the rest of the series, is to maintain a spirit of playful discovery, the type of play that follows will have more to do with finding numerical patterns, rather than visual ones.

## Exponential property

<Figure

Take a close look at the exponent term $2t+dt$. A core property of exponentials is that you can break this up as $2^{t} \cdot 2^{dt}$. That really is the most important property of exponentials; if you add two values in the exponent, you can break it apart as a product of some kind. It lets you relate additive ideas, like tiny steps in time, to multiplicative ideas, like rates and ratios.

<Figure
  image="figures/algebra/base-2-apply-exponential-property.svg" 
/>

Just look at what happens here, after that move, we can factor out the term $2^t$, which is now multiplied by $\frac{2^{dt} - 1}{dt}$. The derivative of $2^t$ is whatever this whole expression approaches as $dt$ approaches $0$.

<Figure
  image="figures/algebra/base-2-derivative.svg" 
/>

At first glance this might like an unimportant manipulation, but a tremendously important fact is that this term on the right, where all the $dt$ stuff lives, is completely separate from the $t$ term itself; it doesn’t depend on the actual time where we started.

If you go to your calculator and plug in small values for $dt$ here, for example typing in $(20.001 - 1)/(0.001)$, you’ll find that it for smaller and smaller choices of $dt$, this value approaches a specific number, around $0.6931...$

Don’t worry if that number seems mysterious, the central point is that this is some kind of constant; unlike derivatives of other functions, all the stuff that depends on $dt$ is separate from the value of $t$ itself.

So the derivative of $2^t$ is just itself, but multiplied by some constant. This should kind of make sense, because earlier it felt like the rate of growth for our population with size $2^t$, at least for changes of a full day, was related to the value $2^t$ itself.

Evidently the rate of change for this function over much smaller time scales is not quite equal to itself, but it is proportional to itself, with this peculiar proportionality constant 0.6931...

## Different Exponentials

There’s not much special to the number $2$ here. Had we dealt with the function $3^t$, the exponential property would also have led us to the conclusion that the derivative of $3^t$ is proportional to itself, but this time with a proportionality constant of about $1.0986$. For any other base to your exponent you can have fun seeing what the various proportionality constants are, maybe trying to find a pattern.

<Figure
  image="figures/algebra/example-exponentials.svg" 
/>

For example, if you plug in (8a tiny number - 1)/(that same tiny number), you can see the relevant proportionality constant is around $2.079$.

And maybe, just maybe, you would notice that this number happens to be exactly $3$ times the constant associated with the base of $2$. So these numbers aren’t random, there is some pattern.
But what is the pattern? What does $2$ have to do with $0.6931$ and what does $8$ have to do with $2.079$.

<Figure
  image="figures/different-exponentials/examples.svg" 
/>

A second question, which ultimately explains these mystery constants, is whether there is some base where that proportionality constant is $1$; where the derivative of at is not just proportional to itself, but equal to itself.

## Euler's Number

<Figure
  image="figures/different-exponentials/eulers-number.svg" 
/>

There is! It’s the special constant $e$, around $2.71828$. In fact, it’s not just that $e$ happens to show up here, this is, in a sense, what defines the number $e$.

<Figure
  image="figures/eulers-number/approximate-derivative.svg" 
/>

All exponential functions are proportional to their own derivative, but $e$ alone is the special number so that the proportionality constant is $1$, meaning $e^t$ actually equals its own derivative. So if you look at the graph of $e^t$, it has the peculiar property that the slope of a tangent line to any point on the graph equals the height of that point above the horizontal axis...

### Natural log

The existence of a function like this can answer the question of the mystery constants, and it’s because it gives a different way to think about functions that are proportional to their own derivative. The key is to use the chain rule.

For example, what is the derivative of $e^{3t}$?  Well, you take the derivative of the outermost function, which due to the special nature of $e$ is itself, then multiply by the derivative of the inner function $3^t$, which is the constant $3$.

Or, rather than just applying a rule, you could take this moment to practice the intuition for the chain rule I talked through last video, thinking about how a slight nudge to $t$ changes value of $3^t$, and how that intermediate change nudges the final value of $e^{3t}$.

Either way, the point is, the derivative of the function $e^{c \cdot t}$ is equal to that same constant, $c$, times itself.

And from here, the question of those mystery constants really just comes down to a certain algebraic manipulation.

The number $2$ can also be written as $e^{\ln(2)}$. There's nothing fancy here, this is simply the definition of the natural log, it asks the question "$e$ to the what equals $2$".

So the function $2^t$ is the same as the function $e^{\ln(2)t}$. And from what we just saw, combining the facts that $e^t$ is its own derivative with the chain rule, the derivative of this function is proportional to itself, with a proportionality constant equal to the natural log of $2$.

And indeed, go plug in the natural log of $2$ to a calculator, and you’ll find that it’s $0.6931...$, the mystery constant we ran into earlier.

And same goes for all the other bases, the mystery proportionality constant that pops up when taking derivatives is the natural log of the base; the answer the the question “e to the what equals that base”.

In fact, throughout applications of calculus, you rarely see exponentials written some base to a power t. Instead you almost always write exponentials as e(some constant) t.

It’s all equivalent; any function like $2^t$ or $3^t$ can be written as $e^{c \cdot t}$. The difference is that framing things in terms of $e$ plays much more smoothly with the process of derivatives.

## Why we care

I know this is all pretty symbol heavy, but the reason we care is that all sorts of natural phenomena involve a certain rate of change being proportional to the thing changing. For example, the rate of growth of a population actually does tend to be proportional to the size of the population itself, assuming there isn’t some limited resource slowing that growth down.

If you put a cup of hot water in a cool room, the rate at which the water cools is proportional to the difference in temperature between the room and the water. Or said differently, the rate at which that difference changes is proportional to itself.

If you invest your money, the rate at which it grows is proportional to the amount of money there at any time. 

In all these cases, where some variable’s rate of change is proportional to itself, the function describing that variable over time will be some exponential. And even though there’s lot’s of ways to write any exponential function, it’s very natural to choose to express these functions as $e^{ct}$, since that constant $c$ in the exponent carries a very natural meaning: It’s the same as the proportionality constant between the size of the changing variable and the rate of change.
