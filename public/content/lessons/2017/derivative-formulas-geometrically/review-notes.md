Reviewer Notes:

- I think the opening quote has the potential to be off-putting for students who haven't decided whether they love or hate math. Possibly replace with another quote?
- Plan to split lesson into two parts: 1) Derivatives of Monomial Terms and 2) Derivatives of Trig. Functions
- For the derivative of 1/x, the answer is left out of the video to encourage the viewer to engage with the content. For the article, should the solution be included in an accordion?
- Does isometric projection for cube read OK?
