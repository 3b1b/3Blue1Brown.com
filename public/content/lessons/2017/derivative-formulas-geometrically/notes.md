Reviewer Notes:

- I think the opening quote has the potential to be off-putting for students who haven't decided whether they love or hate math.
- 



Proposal: Rearrange $f(x)=x^n$ section so that the power rule is discovered instead of explained.

The motivation for this would be to prioritize the first time calculus student (unaware of the power rule) and align this section with some of the goals outlined at the beginning of the series.

Otherwise, I think the section as it stands already works well, especially for someone who has dabbled in Calculus before. I made edits below if that is the direction we should go.
