Kurt's Notes:

- Should the summation notation start at n=1?
- It feels fine to have a gut-check section for the antiderivative of sine

Grant's Notes:

- This should be two short articles:
    - Finding the average value of a function?
    - In what sense are slopes and areas inverses?

 - I wonder if there's a way to open with the central question. 
    - The standard visual intuition for a derivative of a function is that it gives the slope of the graph of that function. The standard visual intuition for a function's integral is that it gives the area under the graph of that function. 
      
    In this series, we've played with other ways to visualize derivatives, and we've already seen one view that helps explain the fundamental theorem of calculus, which explains the sense in which derivatives and integrals are inverses of each other. But in light of the more typical visualization for derivatives, you might wonder, in what sense are slope and area opposites?

    <!-- - It would also be nice to redesign the thumbnail. -->
    
- Before jumping into the main line of reasoning, we should have a section on "quick intuition"
    - The way this works is to take the area under the curve, and divide it by width of that region. You might imagine that area as a pile of sand, and if you shake it all down to be flat, i.e. forming a rectangle whose area matches the area under the curve, the height of that rectangle should the the average height of the function. That height, of then, is the area of the rectangle divided by its width.
    - [Circle the formula]
    - This is intuitive, but you might find it worthwhile to also think about how this relates to the more familiar method of averaging finitely many numbers, which is to add them all up and divide by how many there are.
    - A very common feeling is that when you use a sum in a discrete context, you use an integral in a continuous context. But to avoid subtle errors in making this translation, its useful to be able to think exactly how and why the analogy from sums to integrals works in various contexts where it comes up.
    - This question of finding the average value of a function offers a great chance to exercise that muscle.

<!-- - Is the visual under "...sum by how many values there are." a bit confusing? -->
<!-- - For all the visuals that show adding the heights, we should also show an explicit formula: sum_{n=1}^N sin(\pi / n) -->
<!-- - Remove the word "so" from sentence starts. -->
<!-- - The portion showing the anti-derivative of sine being -cosine feels belabored. It should maybe exist in an accordion.  -->

- "And take a moment to remember the connection between this idea of a continuous average and the usual finite notion of an average" This can probably be deleted.
    - In general, this "generalizing" section can be much more succinct.
