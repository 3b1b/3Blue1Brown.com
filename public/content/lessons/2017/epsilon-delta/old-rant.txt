## No infinitely small rant

Now, if you’ll pardon me for a small rant here, I want to emphasize that nothing about this righthand side references the paradoxical idea of an "infinitely small" change. The point of limits is to avoid that.

This value $h$ is the exact same thing as the "$dx$" I’ve been referencing throughout the series. It’s a nudge to the input of $f$ with some non-zero, finitely small size, like $0.001$, it’s just that we’re analyzing what happens for arbitrarily small choices of $h$. In fact, the only reason people introduce a new variable name into this formal definition, rather than just using $dx$, is to be super-extra clear that these changes to the input are ordinary numbers that have nothing to do with infinitesimals.[^1]

[^1]: Infinitesimals are quantities formally defined in the hyperreal number system to solve calculus type problems. Defining the operations and properties of these infinitely small, but non-zero quantities, essentially treating them like entities, can be used to define the dual number system and evaluate the derivatives of functions programmatically.

You see, there are others who like to interpret $dx$ as an "infinitely small change", whatever that would mean, or to just say that $dx$ and $df$ are nothing more than symbols that shouldn’t be taken too seriously. But by now in the series, you know that I’m not really a fan of either of those views, I think you can and should interpret $dx$ as a concrete, finitely small nudge, just so long as you remember to ask what happens as it approaches $0$.

For one thing, and I hope the past few lessons have helped convince you of this, that helps to build a stronger intuition for where the rules of calculus actually come from. But it’s not just some trick for building intuitions. Everything I’ve been saying about derivatives with this concrete-finitely-small-nudge philosophy is just a translation of the formal definition of derivatives.

Long story short, the big fuss about limits is that they let us *avoid* talking about infinitely small changes by instead asking what happens as the size of some change to our variable approaches $0$.
