evaluate at zero

-log(1-x)

^ radius of convergence

TODO: maybe add "and in the case of the exponential function where the series converges for all values, this can be used as a definition of the exponential function throughout other areas of math."

TODO: maybe highligh the fact that this approach is different than finding the best fit polynomial for say the range [-π/2, π/2]. We really are interested in the best approximation for values close to zero and, as we will see, this will lead us to the Taylor Series polynomials in this lesson.
