Notes from Kurt:

- Link to figma page: https://www.figma.com/design/mrGqFEpSdqWmWCgv0Yer6I/Essence-of-Linear-Algebra?node-id=11-328
- Thoughts on keeping the original input for the vectors, dots, and grid visuals?
- TODO: Vectorize "What makes a transformation 'linear'?" section
- Note on "Then you could make high schoolers memorize this formula for no apparent reason."
- Moved the "formal properties" into their own section. Referenced from dot products lesson.
