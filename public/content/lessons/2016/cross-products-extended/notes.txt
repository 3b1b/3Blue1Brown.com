Notes from Kurt:

- Link to figma page: https://www.figma.com/design/mrGqFEpSdqWmWCgv0Yer6I/Essence-of-Linear-Algebra?node-id=45-2
- The last line "Next up is a really important concept in linear algebra: Change of basis." contradicts that the next lesson is about Cramer's Rule.
- Should lesson links try and avoid mentioning the chapter number and instead use the chapter title or something like it?
- The typesetting of $\left[ \begin{array}{c} x \\ y \\ z \end{array} \right]$ disrupts the paragraph grouping, so I updated the text to use $\vec{\mathbf{u}}$ instead. I've also had it where teachers write vectors horizontally, but I think I prefer the variable approach instead?
- The moving camera really helps the brain understand the layout of 3d space, I experimented with drawing the corresponding rectangular prisms for the vectors to help the reader understand the geometry from a static perspective. This is the same approach that I would use if I was drawing the vectors by hand with some vanishing points.
- The parallelepiped whicht talks about volume is drawn with $\vec{\mathbf{v}}$ and $\vec{\mathbf{w}}$ drawn lying on the $xy$-plane... should this be pointed out to the student?
- TODO: animate figure that has the caption "Even though we are drawing the vector..."
- Potential question: What is the signed volume of this parallelepiped? 
- Potential question: Computing the determinant with variables for u (x y z) and collecting like terms
