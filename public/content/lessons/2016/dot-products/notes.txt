- From Kurt: I think the end of the "unit vector" section and the "duality" section are going to be the hardest for the student, I tried to create a good question, but maybe there are some other considerations here.
- From Grant: The section on linear transformations and duality could also be broken out as a separate article. In that case, we'd simply end this one with the question, prompting one to read the next article if they want to see the connection.
    "There's also another big question other than the order: Why on earth does this numerical process of matching coordinates, multiplying pairs, and adding them together have anything to do with projection?"
