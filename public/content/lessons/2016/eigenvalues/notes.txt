Notes from Kurt:

- Left introduction in first person because it is an opinion.
- Changed sneaky vector to [1 -1] from [-1 1] for formatting purposes.
- Most transformations are illustrated using a before and after image. Some of these could be made more compact by comparing them left-to-right, but I left most of them as top-to-bottom comparisons because it was faster to illustrate.
- Does solving the characteristic polynomial and finding there is only one eigenvalue guarantee that there is only one line of eigenvectors?
