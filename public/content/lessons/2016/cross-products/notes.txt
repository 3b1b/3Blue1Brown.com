Notes from Kurt:

- Link to figma page: https://www.figma.com/design/mrGqFEpSdqWmWCgv0Yer6I/Essence-of-Linear-Algebra?node-id=487-23664
- In the video the example starts as [3 2] cross [2 -1], but then changes to [3 1] cross [1 -2] between sections. Note, both have the same cross product of -7.
- TODO: change colors of "two dimensions" section to be yellow and purple
- Possibly reword sentence containing the word "prototypical"
- Should the parallelogram always be the same color as the first operand vector in the cross product?
- Should there be some comprehension questions applying the notational trick formula? Or should the student be encouraged into the next more in-depth lesson?
- TODO: replace `./figures/compute-with-determinant/determinant-basis-vectors-transformed-orientation.png` with image callback from chapter five
