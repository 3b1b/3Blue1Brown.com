Notes from Kurt:

- The question at the end of the "Choosing Different Basis Vectors" section is a good question, but given the flow of the preceeding paragraph "I'll go into much more detail on this point in a later chapter, describing the relationship between different coordinate systems..." does it make sense to punt it later down the road? If it stayed, I think I would want to write a different explanation since we haven't talked about linear systems of equations yet.
- TODO: add animation for illustrations below "Take a moment to think about all the different vectors you can get by choosing two scalars, using each to scale one of the vectors, then adding them. Which two-dimensional vectors can you reach by altering your choice of scalars?"
- TODO: Create SVGs for "vectors vs points" section
- The section about differing terminologies was removed from before the conclusion section.
