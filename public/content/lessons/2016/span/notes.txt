Notes from Kurt:

- The question at the end of the "Choosing Different Basis Vectors" section is a good question, but given the flow of the preceding paragraph "I'll go into much more detail on this point in a later chapter, describing the relationship between different coordinate systems..." does it make sense to punt it later down the road? If it stayed, I think I would want to write a different explanation since we haven't talked about linear systems of equations yet.
- TODO: add animation for illustrations below "Take a moment to think about all the different vectors you can get by choosing two scalars, using each to scale one of the vectors, and then adding them. Which two-dimensional vectors can you reach by altering your choice of scalars?"
- TODO: Create SVGs for the "vectors vs points" section
- The section about differing terminologies was removed from before the conclusion section.
- Removed this question:

    <Question
    question="Given the equation $\alpha \vec{\mathbf{v}} + \beta \vec{\mathbf{w}} =5\hat{\imath} -\frac12\hat{\jmath}$, where $\vec{\mathbf{v}} = \left[\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 2 \end{array}\right]$ and $\vec{\mathbf{w}} = \left[\begin{array}{c} 3 \\ -1 \end{array}\right]$, what are the values of the scalars $\alpha$ and $\beta$?"
    choice1="$\alpha=1\ \beta=0.5$"
    choice2="$\alpha=0.5\ \beta=1.5$"
    choice3="$\alpha=-1\ \beta=-1.5$"
    choice4="$\alpha=0.5\ \beta=-1.5$"
    answer={2}>

    The standard basis vectors are $\hat i = \begin{bmatrix}1\\ 0\end{bmatrix}$ and $\hat j = \begin{bmatrix}0\\ 1\end{bmatrix}$. The vector equation can be separated into a system of equations for the $x$ and $y$ components:

    $$
    \begin{align*}
    \alpha\cdot1+\beta\cdot3&=5\cdot1-0.5\cdot 0=5 \\
    \alpha\cdot2+\beta\cdot(-1)&=5\cdot0-0.5\cdot1=-0.5
    \end{align*}
    $$

    This system of equations can be solved by substitution to get the answer of $\alpha=0.5$ and $\beta=1.5$.
