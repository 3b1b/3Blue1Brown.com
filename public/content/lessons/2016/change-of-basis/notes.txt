- Removed this text right after calculating the inverse: "One way to interpret this is that from Jennifer's perspective, our first basis vector $\hat{\imath}$ has the coordinates $\left[\begin{array}{c} 1/3 \\ -1/3 \end{array}\right]$, and our second basis vector $\hat{\jmath}$ has coordinates $\left[\begin{array}{c} 1/3 \\ 2/3 \end{array}\right]$."
