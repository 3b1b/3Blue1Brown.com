Imagine a sphere of radius one centered at the origin of the 3d coordinate system.

Can you image a transformation matrix from three dimensions to two dimensions that maps the points on the sphere to the $xy$ plane? Is it possible for this transformation to be linear?

<Accordion title="Hint">

Imagine the line formed between the top of the sphere represented by the vector $\left[\begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{array}\right]$ and another point on the sphere represented by the vector $\left[\begin{array}{c} x \\ y \\ z \end{array}\right]$. For vectors with a negative $z$ component, that lie on the lower hemisphere, this line will intersect the $xy$ plane somewhere within the circle with radius one.

For vectors that lie on the upper hemisphere, that lie on the upper hemisphere, this line will intersect the $xy$ plane somewhere outside a circle with radius one.

There is one exception: the line formed between the vector $\left[\begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{array}\right]$ and the top of the sphere $\left[\begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{array}\right]$ does not pass through the plane, since they are the same vector.
