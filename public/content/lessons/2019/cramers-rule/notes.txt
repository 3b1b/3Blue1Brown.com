Kurt notes:

- To convert the article to dark mode illustrations (to match the rest of the series) replace ".light" with "" in the sources.
- Add footnote from Grant's youtube comment about "orthnormal vs. orthogonal" matrices.
- TODO: question with orthnormal matrix
- TODO: link specific previous chapter in "So as we talked about in a previous chapter"?
