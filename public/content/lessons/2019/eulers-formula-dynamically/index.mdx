One way to think about the function $e^t$ is to ask what properties it has. Probably the most important one, from some points of view the defining property, is that it’s a function which is equal to its own derivative. Together with the added condition that inputting $0$ returns $1$, it’s the only function with this property. 

<Figure image="1_equation.svg"/>

You can illustrate what that means with a physical model: Think of $e^t$ as your position on a number line as a function of time. The condition $e^0 = 1$ means you start at $1$.  The equation above is saying that your velocity, the derivative of position, is always equal to your position. In other words, the farther away from 0 you are, the faster you move, with the very specific constraint that your velocity vector is perpetually identical to your position vector.

<Figure image="1_img.png"/>

So even before knowing how to compute $e^t$ exactly, this ability to associate each position with the velocity you must have at that position paints a very strong intuitive picture of how the function must grow. You know you’ll be accelerating, at an accelerating rate, with an all-around feeling of things getting out of hand quickly.

<Figure image="ExpGraph.png"/>

If we add a constant to this exponent, like $e^{2t}$, the chain rule tells us the derivative of our function is now $2$ times the function itself.

<Figure image="2_equation.svg"/>

So at every point on the number line, rather than attaching a vector corresponding to the number itself, first double the magnitude, then attach it. Moving so that your position is always $e^{2t}$ is the same thing as moving in such a way that your velocity is always twice your position. The implication of that $2$ is that our runaway growth feels all the more out of control.

<Figure image="2_img.png"/>

If that constant was negative, say -0.5, then your velocity vector is always -0.5 times your position vector, meaning you flip it around 180-degrees, and scale its length by a half.

<Figure image="3_equation.svg"/>
Moving in such a way that your velocity always matches this flipped and squished copy of the position vector, you’d go the other direction, slowing down in exponential decay towards 0.

<Figure image="-0.5_img.png"/>

What about if the constant was $i$, the imaginary unit?  If your position was always $e^{it}$, how would you move as that time, $t$, ticks forward?

Well, assuming there’s any way to make sense out of $e^{it}$, and assuming that derivatives still work the way we’d expect when extending to complex numbers, the derivative of your position $e^{it}$ would now always be $i$ times itself. Multiplying by $i$ has the effect of rotating numbers 90-degrees, and as you might expect, things only make sense here if we start thinking beyond the number line and in the complex plane.

<Question
  question="Geometrically, which of the following describes the point $i \cdot (a + bi)$ on the complex plane?"
  choices={[
    "A 90-degree clockwise rotation of the point $a + bi$ about the origin.",
    "A 90-degree counterclockwise rotation of the point $a + bi$ about the origin.",
    "A reflection of the point $a + bi$ about the real axis.",
    "A reflection of the point $a + bi$ about the imaginary axis.",
  ]}
  answer={2}
  explanation="Multiplying by $i$ has the effect of rotating a given number by 90 degrees. The point $i \cdot (a + bi)$ is equivalent to $i$ multiplied by $a+bi$, resulting in $a+bi$ being rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise about the origin."

So even before you know how to compute $e^{it}$, you know that for any position this might give for some value of t, the velocity at that time will be a 90-degree rotation of that position.  

<Figure image="RotatedVectors.png" imageCaption="Each blue arrow above pointing outward from the origin represents an example value of $e^{it}$, thought of as a position vector. The corresponding green arrow at its tip shows what the velocity, equal to the position rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise, would have to be for that particular position."/>

Drawing this for all possible positions you might come across, we get a vector field, where, usually with vector fields we shrink things down to avoid clutter.

<Figure image="ExpVectorField.png" video="images/vect_anim.mp4"/>

At time $t=0$, $e^{it}$ will be 1. There’s only one trajectory starting from that position where your velocity is always matching the vector it’s passing through, a 90-degree rotation of position. It’s when you go around the unit circle at a speed of 1 unit per second. 

<Figure video="rotate_anim.mp4" image="images/complex_img2.png" show="video"/>

So after pi seconds, you’ve traced a distance of pi around; $e^{i\pi} = -1$.  

<Figure image="e^ipi.png"/>

After $\tau = 2\pi$ seconds, you’ve gone full circle; $e^{i\tau} = 1$. 

<Figure image="e^itau.png"/>

And more generally, $e^{it}$ equals a number $t$ radians [[1]](lessons/differential-equations/#footnotes) around this circle.

Nevertheless, something might still feel immoral about putting an imaginary number up in that exponent.  And you’d be right to question that!  For values of $x$ which are not real numbers, what we write as $e^x$ has very little to do with repeated multiplication, and its relation to the number $e$ feels frankly more incidental than definitional. To dig in a little bit deeper, the next lesson covers more general exponents, with a focus on matrices.
