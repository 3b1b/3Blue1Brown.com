Notes from Kurt:

- "You can skip ahead" rewrite to transition either to the next chapter or the quick tip formula

- There's a visual that could be recreated for: "This should make sense if you understand that an eigenvalue describes how much an operator stretches space in a particular direction and that the determinant describes how much an operator scales areas (or volumes)."

- Which video is Grant referring to for:

    "I've actually found myself using this trick a lot when I'm sketching quick notes related to linear algebra and using small matrices as examples. I've been working on a video about matrix exponents, where eigenvalues pop up, and I realized it's just very handy if students can read off the eigenvalues from small examples without losing the main line of thought by getting bogged down in calculations."
    
    Is it this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O85OWBJ2ayo?

    Probably makes sense to add a footnote. In the meantime I've changed the text to be:
    
    This trick is especially useful when you need to read off the eigenvalues from small examples without losing the main line of thought by getting bogged down in calculations.

- What does the diagram with the wedge downwards and the u-block upwards demonstrate?

- Small error in the video where -sqrt(25 - 9) and +sqrt(25 - 9) are flipped
