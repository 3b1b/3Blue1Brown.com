### What do you use to animate your videos?


Almost all animations are made using a custom open-source Python library named [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim). Code for specific videos can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/3b1b/videos).  I made a video to demo the tool [here](https://youtu.be/rbu7Zu5X1zI).

I started the project concurrently with starting the channel, intending for it to be more of a scrappy playground of code for my own use cases than an explicitly outward-facing or professionally maintained tool. Since its inception, a [community](https://www.manim.community/) got together and created an [alternate fork](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/) which is aimed at being more stable, better documented, and better tested. Anyone looking to get started with Manim should probably begin with the community version.

The version I use for 3b1b videos is perhaps best viewed as a testing ground where I try to quickly put new things together while developing new videos.

If you want to make your own animated math videos, I would encourage you to also take a look at the full landscape of tools available, such as Desmos, Geogebra and Mathematica. The main difference between manim and other math-visualizing tools is that it’s structured to build potentially long scenes for videos and to hopefully look smoother and prettier than, say, matplotlib.

Keep in mind that plenty of professional animation tools like Blender and After Effects can be made programmatic too. Also, be sure to ask yourself if what you’re doing benefits from being programmatic at all. If all you’re looking to do is simple moving/fading animations, using something simple like Keynote or PowerPoint might take you farther than you’d expect.

It’s wonderful to see others using manim, especially if it helps them explain math in ways that otherwise would have been hard. But every so often I see folks using it mainly to animate simple movements or to write and manipulate Latex expressions. In those cases (and I fully acknowledge the hypocrisy here) I can’t help but speculate that another tool might have made the job easier. I also get worried when I hear people ask things like “How do I sync up narration into manim?”. This is just a tool for spitting out the individual clips to be edited together later, you should certainly use traditional video-editing software for as much as you can.

Where programmatic animations work best is when you have a situation where the code directly reflects the math you’re trying to explain, or where iteration, abstraction, and conditionals make a set of illustrations possible which otherwise would have taken much too long to do manually.

### What does the name 3blue1brown refer to?


<Portrait image="/images/contact/logo.svg" size="100px" />

I'll be the first to admit this is a little odd. The logo is a loose depiction of my right eye color. It has what's known as "sectoral heterochromia", meaning there are different colors in different sectors, which in my case looks like 3/4 blue and 1/4 brown.

In the same way that many channels simply share their name with the author, a younger me thought that a unique genetic signature might be neat. Plus, the channel is all about seeing math in certain ways, so it felt fitting. The name is just a reference to the logo, factoring in a desire for something deliberately weird-sounding that stands out.

### Can I contribute/fix translations of the videos?

That would be wonderful, thank you! For subtitles, my friend Ben Eater built [the website Criblate](https://criblate.com/) to make it easier for communities to contribute translations to YouTube channels they follow.
There, you can review a translation, whose first pass was often machine generated. Once your edits are approved, it will be added as the official subtitles for that language on YouTube with attribution to you.

Regarding dubs on the channel, we already have translators working on that for Spanish, French, Hindi, Portuguese, Russian and Japanese. There is currently [an application](https://forms.gle/rKZ9zeyh8NFVGyn66) up to hire translators for Arabic, Korean and Vietnamese.

If you feel passionately about contributing in another language, and have experience with narration and voice-overs, feel free to contact us, but keep in mind there is a finite budget, so we may not be able to accommodate.

Since YouTube is not available in China, there is a small team of volunteers that make them available on [Bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/88461692/#/) with Chinese translations. You can find the means of contacting the team on that page if you want to help out.

**You are not allowed to re-upload the content on your own channel, and such re-uploaded content will be taken down as a copyright violation**. I know that might seem harsh, and that many re-uploaded dubbed videos are done in good faith trying to spread math around the world. However, there need to be consistent principles around how the lessons are put out under the channel name. To highlight one potential problem, there is otherwise no mechanism for preventing the insertion of unwanted promotional or sponsored additions, or other sorts of edits that misrepresent the original intent of a video.

<a id="licensing" />

### Can I license these videos/Is it okay to use the material in my own work?

You can feel free to use still images or clips of the videos as long as the following three criteria hold:

1. You are using less than 60 seconds of material, and clearly adding to it in the surrounding context (i.e. you are not reuploading a clip).
2. There is clear on-screen attribution to 3blue1brown.
3. You provides links where applicable so someone can easily find the original.

If you are looking for longer usage than that, for instance looking to use entire videos on an alternate educational platform, please reach out to us via the form  below with a licensing inquiry.

### Will you speak at our event?

I'm trying to keep talks to a mininum this year, so just know that I have to decline most requests coming in.
Nevertheless, feel free to fill in the [contact form](/faq#contact) below with details, including the date, location and whether you have any estimated speaking fee in mind.

### My organization would like to sponsor one of your videos

The channel [no longer does brand integrations](https://www.patreon.com/posts/going-sponsor-19586800).

### What's the music playing in your videos?


<Portrait image="/images/about/vincent-rubinetti.jpg" />

You can find it on [Bandcamp](https://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-3blue1brown), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/1dVyjwS8FBqXhRunaG5W5u), [Apple Music](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-music-of-3blue1brown/1448166136), and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/music/listen?u=0#/wst/album/Bk27zbtbjerlpajx3kplrvy3goe). Almost all of it was written by Vince Rubinetti. The piano pieces used in the Linear Algebra and Calculus series, which Vince listed as “Grant’s etude” and “Grant’s Opus” on the album, are little snippets that I wrote.

For usage and licensing questions, see [this form](https://vincerubinetti.github.io/using-the-music-of-3blue1brown/) on Vince's site.

### What books/resources do you recommend for learning math?

See [this post](/blog/book-recommendations) for book recommendations, and [this one](/blog/recommendations) for recommendations on other resources.

### I'd like to ask you a question about math, or about one of your videos.

I wish I had the time to respond with thoughtful answers to all the people writing in with questions, but the unfortunate reality is that I don't. You can write in if you want, but you will likely have better luck asking on an active forum online somewhere.

If you are a [Patreon supporter](https://www.patreon.com/3blue1brown), and you ask a question about a new video after its early release there, I'll try my best to either answer in the Patreon comments or, better yet, to incorporate an answer to the question in the final version of the video before it goes out to the wider public, so that all viewers can benefit.

For general questions, it's worth noting that LLMs these days are really quite good with standard math topics. There are caveats, of course, and it's always a good idea to fact-check claims that are important or sound dubious. Nevertheless, I've noticed that quite a few questions people write in to ask about could be answered both quickly and effectively with most of the latest LLMs.

### I believe I've solved a famous unsolved math problem/developed a novel idea. Will you check it for me?

Unfortunately, no. There are two important things to note here:

1. I am not a research mathematician, so am not the one to ask.
2. There is too little time as it is to read and learn all the things I’d like to read, so I have to draw certain boundaries on where that time goes.

### I'd like to get started making math videos online, do you have any advice?

When we kicked off the Summer of Math Exposition in 2021, I made [a video](https://youtu.be/ojjzXyQCzso) centered around this question. Here are the main points I made there:

- Just get started. Begin iterating and receiving feedback before overthinking it.
- When explaining new topics, try putting concrete and specific ideas before general and abstract frameworks. This runs contrary to how most of us start explaining things that we already understand well.
- Topic choice matters way more than production quality.
- That said, get a good microphone and learn how to use it (an embarrassing number of 3blue1brown videos have terrible audio.)
- Embrace niche topics, especially when getting started, rather than trying to cast the widest net you can.
- Know your genre, and be wary of pattern matching from creators outside your genre. Some educational creators play the role of student documenting their own learning, others play the role of an expert conveying what they've spent years learning, others are teachers targeting students in school, others are journalists trying to summarize recent breakthroughs. All these (and more) have value, but they have different implications for pacing and style, so what works for one may not work for another.
- In math especially, topic definitions should not be seen as a starting point, but an ending point.
- Always ask what picture or visual you could use to elucidate a topic. It doesn't have to be fancy, and sometimes topics don't lend themselves to a visual, but it's always worth asking.
- Using math animation software (like manim) can be useful when the topic at hand lends itself to a programmatic description, but I've seen many people overuse and abuse it, e.g. by just displaying a series of equations or text which are unnecessarily animated.

Various [other](https://youtu.be/F3Qixy-r_rQ) [videos](https://youtu.be/cDofhN-RJqg) I've made associated with the summer of math exposition also implicitly convey thoughts I have about the matter.
