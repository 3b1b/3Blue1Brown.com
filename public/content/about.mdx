# About the Channel

3blue1brown, or 3b1b for short, is primarily a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/3blue1brown) about discovery and creativity in math, with an emphasis on visualizations.
On this site, you can find written versions of many of these lessons, often with more interactive elements sprinkled in.

Some lessons cover standard topics people may be searching for,such as <LessonLink id="vectors">linear algebra</LessonLink>, <LessonLink id="neural-networks">neural networks</LessonLink>, <LessonLink id="essence-of-calculus">calculus</LessonLink>,&nbsp; <LessonLink id="fourier-transforms">Fourier transforms</LessonLink>, <LessonLink id="light-quantum-mechanics">quantum mechanics</LessonLink>, and many more.

Other lessons <LessonLink id="clacks">are</LessonLink> <LessonLink id="inscribed-rectangle-problem">more</LessonLink> <LessonLink id="hardest-problem">purely</LessonLink> <LessonLink id="prime-spirals">playful</LessonLink>, exploring puzzles and problems with some intrinsic beauty, particularly those which seem quite challenging at first, but where some shift in perspective makes it both doable and beautiful.
 
The first category aims to motivate math by its usefulness, and the second aims to motivates math as an art form, though of course, the line dividing these two is easily blurred.

# About the Author

<Portrait image="images/about/grant.png"/>

My name is Grant Sanderson.
These videos, and the [animation engine](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) behind them, began as side projects as I was wrapping up my time studying math and computer science at Stanford.
After graduating, I worked for Khan Academy producing videos, articles and exercises, primarily focussed on multivariable calculus. Since the end of 2016, my primary focus has been on 3blue1brown and its associated projects.

In those years, I've also had the pleasure of contributing to a number of different outlets for math exposition, including spending a semester lecturing for an MIT course on computational thinking, contributing a Netflix documentary about infinity, writing for Quanta, and collaborating with many other educational YouTube channels.

# Contributors, past and present

### Kurt Bruns, Artist

<Portrait image="images/about/kurt-bruns.png" />

Hello, my name is Kurt Bruns.
I graduated from the University of Utah with a degree in Computer Science.
After an internship spent adapting the [Calculus Video Series](/topics/calculus), I do the digital artwork for new videos.
In my free time, I'm building a math website, making art and playing ultimate frisbee.

### James Schloss, Summer of Math Exposition

<Portrait image="images/about/james-schloss.png"/>

Hello, I am Dr. James Schloss.
I finished my PhD at the [Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.oist.jp/) in December 2019 and did a short stint at MIT before deciding to work as an independent researcher.
I help run the [Summer of Math Exposition](https://3blue1brown.com/some1), and other logistics concerning the website and 3b1b podcast.

### Josh Pullen, 2021 Intern

<Portrait image="images/about/josh-pullen.png" />

Hello! I'm Josh Pullen. I work on this website and help transform the 3Blue1Brown lessons into written and interactive versions.

I fell in love with programming as a kid, which inevitably gave me an appreciation for math as well. Today, nothing brings me more joy than sharing that passion with others,[^1] which is why I am currently at Michigan State University preparing to become a teacher.

### River Way, 2021 Intern

<Portrait image="images/about/river-way.png" />

Hey! I'm River, thanks for stopping by! Currently, I am studying quantum computation in Bern, Switzerland; my undergraduate years were spent at Stevens in New Jersey. I had a hard time deciding if I wanted to do mathematics, physics, or computer science so I landed on quantum computers which blend all three together beautifully. I've always had a passion for finding new ways to explain anything interesting, using modern technology as a new medium for education is our future. If you're intrigued by quantum computers, artificial intelligence, or computer graphics, check out some of my other projects!

### Vivek Verma, 2021 Intern

<Portrait image="images/about/vivek-verma.jpeg" />

Hi! I'm Vivek. Currently, I'm a first year at UC Berkeley, working towards a degree in Computer Science and Applied Math. I run a Math YouTube channel, [vcubingx](https://youtube.com/vcubingx), that utilizes [manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) to explain topics I find fascinating. I've always been a visual learner, and love creating animations and visualizations to explain math concepts. Feel free to check out any of my work if you're interested!

[^1]: Actually, I would like to immediately retract my statement.

    Many things bring me great joy. Like sugary cereal, and spending time with people I love.
