The recent boom of _Generative AI_ Language Models, namely Chat GPT, has led to two important questions:
1. Will AI take over the world?
2. How does the _GPT_ model work?

While the future of AI's role in society can only be answered with time, Grant seeks to explore the second question-how the _GPT_ model truly works-through his videos on Transformers.

## What is a GPT model?
Formally speaking, a GPT is a **Generative Pre-Trained Transformer**. The first two words are self-explanatory: **generative** means the model generates new text; **pre-trained** means the model was trained on large amounts of data. What Grant focuses on is the **transformer** aspect of the language model, the main proponent of the recent boom in AI.
### What exactly is a Transformer?
A **transformer** is a special kind of neural network, a _Machine Learning Model_. There are a wide variety of models that can be built using **transformers**: voice-to-text, text-to-voice, text-to-image, machine translation, and many more.
