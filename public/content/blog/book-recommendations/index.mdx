## Textbooks
For those in college, here's a small selection of textbooks I found particularly well-written.

In reading, really try to predict what proofs will look like, and be willing to meditate on what the right way to think about a given object is.  Ask yourself if each new construct feels motivated, or if it's out of the blue.  If it is out of the blue, it's okay to move forward anyway, just keep note of the fact that there is a lurking question mark.  Read with a pencil and paper so you can sketch things out and scribble solutions to exercises as you come across them.
