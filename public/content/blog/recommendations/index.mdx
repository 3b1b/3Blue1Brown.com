If there’s one thing I hope 3blue1brown videos do, it’s to inspire people to spend more time playing with and learning about math. Below are a few selected resources which I’d recommend should you find yourself so inspired.

## Practice
Passive consumption, say by watching videos or reading books, is certainly the lowest friction way to expose yourself to new math.  But if you care about long-term retention and deeper understanding, there really is no substitute for practice.  So before getting to other YouTube channels and books you might enjoy, here are a few places you can go to be more active about the learning.

The first is [brilliant.org](https://brilliant.org/).  I know a few of the people there, and I can vouch for the fact that they are extremely thoughtful about what makes for good learning.  It shows in the product.  Rather than putting lectures and videos front and center, problems and puzzles take precedence, all presented in a structured progression.  The site also benefits from an active and helpful community of users.

Another good reservoir of problems with a helpful community surrounding them is the [Art of Problem Solving](https://artofproblemsolving.com/).  In particular, they have an extensive [archive of contest math problems](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c13_contests), ranging from more approachable ones like the AMC8 to extremely hard ones like the IMO, all with excellent surrounding discussion from the community.

The original [Art of Problem Solving book](https://artofproblemsolving.com/store/item/aops-vol1) by Richard Rusczyk, by the way, was one of the things that made me fall in love with creative math as a young student.

[Mathigon](https://mathigon.org/) is a very beautifully done set of interactive articles on all sorts of fun topics in math.  The experience sits somewhere between reading and playing a game, with a really wonderful blend of artwork, technology and pedagogical clarity.

For building up your fundamentals, say starting with algebra, take a look at [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/).  They are probably most famous for the videos Sal does, but arguably the site is most valuable as a source of problems you can drill on, starting from the very basics if necessary.  I may be biased, though, given that I used to work there!

Sidenote: Some of the companies listed above have sponsored 3blue1brown videos in the past, but the recommendations above are not sponsored or advertisements in any way.
