title: 3Blue1Brown.com Contribution Guidelines

The goal of 3blue1brown.com is to provide free, high-quality math lessons to everyone. 3blue1brown began life as a YouTube channel, and videos remain the lifeblood of this project. But providing written versions of each lesson for people who prefer to read or are unable to watch the videos is one more step towards making the joys of math available to all.

This website began life as a project between myself, a few close friends, and some paid interns. Together, we brought the site to life and created written versions of many of the most popular 3blue1brown videos. Along the way, we learned a lot about how to create high-quality written lessons.

But despite our best efforts, converting the entire backlog of videos was too big a task. There are over 100 videos now, and many still do not have writtern versions available on this website. So, if you are feeling ambitious and would like to help, we would greatly appreciate your contribution.

## The Goal
Our goal is to convert every single 3blue1brown video into a high-quality written form. If you are feeling ambitious and generous with your time, we would love your help. You can choose a video to make your own, perform the conversion, and submit your results for publication here on 3blue1brown.com.

### Setting Expectations
Converting videos is no easy task, so we want to make sure you know what you're getting yourself into. Please give each of these downsides some careful consideration before jumping in:
- **Converting a video can easily take 40+ hours of work.** It's a big commitment.
- **You may be rejected.** Unfortunately, we sometimes have to reject submissions that don't meet the quality standards of the site. From puncuation and grammar to pedagogical choices to image and video quality, there's a lot to consider when writing a lesson, and getting those choices right is essential. We will try to guide you through the process (see the guidelines below), but ultimately, creating a great lesson requires good taste, and if it doesn't work out&mdash;although it pains us to do&mdash;we might have to reject your submission.
- **Converting videos requires some technical expertise.** You will be using an extended form of markdown (called MDX) to write your lesson, using git to submit your contribution, and a wide array of photo and video editing tools to extract and create the figures that are so essential to each lesson.
- **You will not be paid for your work.**
- **3Blue1Brown will own the work you contribute.**

### The Benefits of Contributing
Perhaps we've scared you away from being a contributor. If not, we do have some good news.
- **You will receive attribution for your work at the top of the lesson.** You also have the option to include a link to a personal website or other page that represents you if you so choose. (Of course, the link you provide must be appropriate for general audiences.)
- **Teaching is the best way to learn.** Converting a lesson requires spending a lot of time with the ideas contained within, which invariably leads to a better understanding of the math at hand.
- **Your work will help many people all around the world learn to love math.** 3Blue1Brown.com draws a wide audience, and your work will be seen and enjoyed by many people who may learn something new or even be inspired by what you create.

## The Contribution Process
If you've looked at the pros and cons of contributing and decided that you want to give it a try, then it's time to take a look at how it all works.

<Accordion title="Step 1: Choose a video that needs to be converted and claim it as your own.">

We require all contributors to claim a lesson before they begin work. We want to make sure that there's one person working on each lesson, so that when you choose a lesson, you can be certain that nobody else has already started doing it themselves.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 2: Convert a small portion of the lesson (<5 minutes of video) and submit it for feedback.">

As mentioned above, we have high standards for quality, and rejection is a possibility. For that reason, we want to give you feedback as early in the process as possible. That way, if you need to do something differently, or in the unfortunate event where we need to reject your work entirely, you at least find out before you've put in 40 hours of your life.

During this review process, there are three possibilities:

1. **We reject your submission.** We never want to do this, but if your submission doesn't meet the quality criteria listed later in this post, it might be necessary.
2. **We ask you to improve your sample so that it meets our standards.** If your work is good, but has a few issues, we will ask you to correct those problems and then re-submit your sample.
3. **We accept your sample, and give the green light to continue.** If your work is especially good, and meets all of our standards for quality, we will give you the approval to continue with the rest of the lesson.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 3: Convert the rest of the lesson.">

Once your sample is approved, you can move on to converting the rest of the video to written form. This is the bulk of the work, and it's where you can expect to spend most of your time.

When you're done, it's the exact same approval process as before, where you can expect to get some feedback and requests for changes. After a few iterations of feedback and improvements, your lesson will be accepted.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 4: Publish your lesson.">

Once your work is approved, we will publish it on 3Blue1Brown.com.

</Accordion>

## Quality Standards & Recommendations

### Images and videos
<Accordion id="figures-from-source" title="Grab all images and video clips directly from the source video.">

Do **not** play the video and then take a screenshot. Doing so will decrease the quality of the image.

To maintain the original quality, use some kind of video editing tool to extract the image or clip directly from the video file.

If you're on a Mac, the built-in QuickTime player works for this:
- Grab a single image from the video by pausing at the moment you want to capture and pressing ⌘C to copy that frame to your clipboard. You can then paste the image wherever you want it. If you want to save it as a file, open Preview and click File > New from Clipboard (⌘N).
- Grab a video clip by pressing ⌘T, then trimming down to the part you want to save. Then choose Edit > Remove Audio to remove the narration.

</Accordion>

<Accordion id="simple-images" title="Edit images to be simple and distraction-free.">

Often in 3Blue1Brown videos, the content on screen starts out simple and slowly becomes more and more complicated as the video progresses. This means that sometimes a frame from the video is too messy to use as a figure in the written version.

In those cases, opening up the image in a photo editor and erasing the non-essential parts of the image can help simplify things.

</Accordion>

<Accordion id="crop-images" title="Crop images to remove dead space.">

The figures in the article do not have to be any particular size. So if only part of the screen is being used in the original video, crop that image down so that everything fits without much dead space.

Also, try to keep the contents of the image nicely centered.

</Accordion>

<Accordion id="prefer-images" title="Prefer static images over video clips wherever possible.">

Static images are better for quick viewing, and give the reader control over the pace.

If a video clip is being used to show a transition from one state to another, consider creating an image that shows the "before" and "after" pictures, possibly with an arrow between them.

In most cases, you'll find that with some careful editing you can create a static image that conveys all the same ideas as the original video.

</Accordion>

<Accordion id="short-clips" title="Keep video clips short and to the point.">

If you must use a video clip, keep it brief. Videos longer than 10 seconds should be seriously considered. Can you trim it down further?

Sometimes the original video timing works nicely with the narration, but is too slow in the context of a written lesson. One useful trick here is to take any awkwardly long pauses and remove them using jump cuts in a video editor. Usually with a bit of careful editing, you can make those cuts totally seamless.

</Accordion>

<Accordion id="silent-clips" title="Video clips should be silent, with all narration removed.">

Except in rare cases, video files should be completely silent. They should never include the narration from the original video.

</Accordion>

<Accordion id="mp4" title="Use the .mp4 format for all video files.">

If your files are in the wrong format, you can convert them to mp4 using an online tool like [CloudConvert](https://cloudconvert.com/).

Or, if you're terminal-savvy, you might prefer to use ffmpeg. Here's a command to convert all the .mov files in the working directory to .mp4 on Linux or Mac[^1]:

```
for i in *.mov; do ffmpeg -i "$i" "${i%.*}.mp4"; done
```

</Accordion>

### Lesson Text

<Accordion id="grammar" title="Make sure spelling, grammar, and punctuation is correct.">

This tip is pretty straightforward.

If you have a hard time remembering which words need aprostrophes or forget whether it's "accept" or "except", you can always ask for help from another community member. There are lots of people willing to find and correct any errors.

</Accordion>

<Accordion id="phrasing" title="Don't be afraid to tweak the phrasing to make sense in a written context.">

Sometimes phrases which make sense when spoken are confusing when written down. You do not need to transcribe the video's narration precisely. Feel free to make adjustments wherever it seems appropriate.

In particular, watch out for long sentences with lots of commas. Those should generally be broken down into a few smaller sentences. (It can take a bit of experimentation to find the phrasing that works best.)

</Accordion>

<Accordion id="footnotes" title="Make use of footnotes to keep distracting/diverging ideas out of the main reading flow.">

There's no such thing as footnotes on YouTube, so sometimes the original video will include ideas or side tangents that are really better suited for a footnote.

If you ever find that a particular sentence or paragraph seems like a diversion that distracts from the main point of the lesson, keep in the back of your mind that you always have the option to tuck it away.

</Accordion>

### Comprehension Questions

<Accordion id="questions" title="Include frequent comprehension questions.">

One of the great benefits of the written form is the ability to include comprehension questions directly in the lesson. Take advantage of this, and include comprehension questions any place they fit.

</Accordion>

<Accordion id="question-difficulty" title="Don't make your questions too difficult.">

Comprehension questions should serve mostly as a little check-in to make sure the reader is paying attention. A reader who is following along should not be stumped by your question. (If you want to pose a more difficult question for readers who want to go above and beyond, that kind of commentary belongs in footnotes.)

Of course, your questions should not be so simple as to insult the reader’s intelligence. It's a balancing act.

</Accordion>

<Accordion id="prefer-mc" title="Prefer multiple choice questions over free response.">

Multiple choice questions allow for a clear right/wrong answer, so they should be preferred over free response questions wherever possible.

If your question is open-ended, consider whether you can rephrase it so that it works in the multiple choice format. But if multiple choice is truly unavoidable, then free response questions can be an excellent option as well.

</Accordion>

<Accordion id="distractors" title={"Include thoughtfully-designed \"distractors\" when writing multiple choice questions."}>

When writing a multiple choice question, think about the errors someone reading the lesson might make, and try to include those incorrect answers as options they can choose.

</Accordion>

<Accordion id="explanations" title="Always include an explanation of the correct answer.">

The question component allows writing an explanation that appears after the user chooses the correct answer. Make sure to fill this space with useful information.

In your explanation, include why the wrong answers are wrong, whenever that would be helpful. (This is especially important if you've done a good job of designing tricky distractors.)

</Accordion>

### Misc.

<Accordion id="no-interactives" title="Do not include interactive elements.">

Interactives generally require ongoing maintainence, which means they aren't really viable as community contributions.
