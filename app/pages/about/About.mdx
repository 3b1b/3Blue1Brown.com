**3Blue1Brown** (3b1b) is primarily a <Link to="https://www.youtube.com/3blue1brown">YouTube channel</Link> about
discovery and creativity in math, with an emphasis on visualizations.

Some lessons cover _standard, commonly-sought topics_ — like linear algebra, calculus, neural networks, quantum computing — motivating math by its usefulness.
Other lessons are more _playful explorations of puzzles and problems_ — ones that seem challenging but become doable and even beautiful with a shift in perspective — motivating math as an art form.

Much 3b1b content exists outside of the channel as well.
On this site you'll find written versions of some videos, often with interactive elements sprinkled in.
On other platforms and elsewhere on the web, you'll find talks, collaborations, projects, and a variety of other content.

<Grant />

My name is Grant Sanderson.
These videos — and <Link to="https://github.com/3b1b/manim">Manim, the animation engine behind them</Link> — began as side projects as I was wrapping up my time studying math and computer science at Stanford.
After graduating, I worked for Khan Academy producing videos, articles and exercises, primarily focussed on multivariable calculus.
Since the end of 2016, my primary focus has been on 3Blue1Brown and its associated projects.

In those years, I've also had the pleasure of contributing to a number of different outlets for math exposition, including spending a semester lecturing for an MIT course on computational thinking, contributing a Netflix documentary about infinity, writing for Quanta, and collaborating with many other educational YouTube channels.
