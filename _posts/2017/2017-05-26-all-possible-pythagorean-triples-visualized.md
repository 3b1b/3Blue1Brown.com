title: All possible pythagorean triples, visualized
description: There are a few special right triangles many of us learn about in school, like the 3-4-5 triangle or the 5-12-13 triangle.  Is there a way to understand all triplets of numbers (a, b, c) that satisfy a^2 + b^2 = c^2?  There is!  And it uses complex numbers in a clever way.
