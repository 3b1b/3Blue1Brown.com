## Animation Test .mp4

Animation served using `git lfs`:

{% include components/figure.html video="https://github.com/3b1b/3Blue1Brown.com/raw/workflow/test/title-animation.mp4" %}

Animation served from static bucket:

{% include components/figure.html video="https://3b1b-posts.website-us-east-1.linodeobjects.com/test/title-animation.mp4" %}

## Future Component

After environments are setup, this is how the component might look:

```
{% include components/figure.html image="figure-4.14-4.57.png" %}
```

```
{% include components/figure.html video="animation-1.27-2.01.mp4" %}
```
