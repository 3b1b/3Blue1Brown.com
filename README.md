To make more structural changes to the site, you may want to build it locally:

1. [Install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
2. [Install RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download)
3. [Install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) by running `gem install bundler jekyll`
4. Start the site by running `bundle exec jekyll serve --trace --open-url --livereload`

The site should automatically open in your default browser.
Any changes you make should automatically rebuild the site and refresh the page, except for changes to `_config.yml` which require re-running the start command.
